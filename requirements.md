## Scope (In/Out)

**Scope (In):**

1. **Appointment Scheduling:** Users can easily browse available time slots and schedule dental appointments with their preferred practitioners.

2. **User Accounts:** Patients and dental professionals can create accounts, manage their profiles, and access their appointment history.

3. **Real-time Availability:** The system will show real-time availability of dentists, allowing patients to select suitable appointment times.

4. **Appointment Reminders:** Automated reminders will be sent to patients before their scheduled appointments, reducing no-shows.

5. **Rescheduling and Cancellations:** Users can reschedule or cancel appointments, ensuring flexibility while optimizing the clinic's schedule.

2. **Integration with Payment Gateways:** The system will not handle payment processing for appointments. Users will need to settle payments directly with the clinic.

## User Flow: Happy Path

1. **User Login or Registration:**
   - The user starts by visiting the website and is prompted to either log in or register for a new account.
   - The user's login credentials or registration data are sent to the server for verification and account creation if needed.

2. **Dashboard/Homepage:**
   - Upon successful login or registration, the user is redirected to their dashboard or homepage.
   - The dashboard displays upcoming appointments, options for scheduling new appointments, and account settings.

3. **Scheduling an Appointment:**
   - The user clicks on the "Schedule Appointment" button and selects their preferred dentist.
   - The application sends a request to the server to retrieve the dentist's available time slots.
   - The server responds with the available time slots, which are displayed to the user.

4. **Selecting a Time Slot:**
   - The user selects a suitable time slot and confirms their choice.
   - The application sends a request to the server to book the appointment for the chosen time.

5. **Appointment Confirmation:**
   - The server confirms the appointment booking and sends a confirmation response to the application.
   - The user receives a confirmation message and the appointment details are added to their dashboard.

6. **Appointment Reminders:**
   - As the appointment time approaches, the application sends automated reminders to the user's registered contact information (email, SMS, etc.).

7. **Managing Appointments:**
   - The user can view, reschedule, or cancel appointments from their dashboard.
   - Requests to reschedule or cancel appointments are sent to the server, and the server updates the appointment status accordingly.

8. **Logging Out:**
   - The user can log out when they are done using the application.
   - The application sends a logout request to the server to invalidate the user's session.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Security**

Requirement: The application must ensure data privacy and secure user information.
Implementation: To achieve this requirement, the application will implement various security measures. User authentication will be enforced using secure protocols such as OAuth or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Data transmission will be encrypted using HTTPS to prevent interception of sensitive information. Role-based access control will be applied to restrict access to different parts of the application based on user roles (patient, dentist, admin).

**Performance**

Requirement: The application should provide fast response times and handle concurrent user requests effectively.
Implementation: To achieve optimal performance, the application's backend will be optimized for efficient data retrieval and processing. Caching mechanisms will be employed to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need for repeated database queries. Images and other static assets will be optimized for web delivery to enhance page loading speed. Continuous performance monitoring and profiling will ensure that the application maintains its responsiveness and speed over time.

**Usability**

Requirement: The application should be intuitive and user-friendly to ensure a positive user experience.
Implementation: To meet this requirement, the application will focus on a clean and intuitive user interface (UI) design. The user interface will be designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes. User testing and feedback will be collected during development to identify any usability issues and make necessary improvements. Clear and concise instructions will be provided for each step of the appointment booking process, and error messages will be designed to guide users in case of input errors.
